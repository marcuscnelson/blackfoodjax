          <p>Our communities in the Valley are tough. We always pull together when things get hard & now is certainly one of those times. Our team at Omni Strategic Technologies thought this might be a way to use our time & talent to help support the small restaurants who are being asked to close the doors to dine in customers & offer only take out or delivery. This webpage will highlight all the places we can support by ordering meals and helping them stay in business until these troubling times pass. If you’re a restaurant owner, fill out our Google form & submit your business to our page. Our hope is to make this a “one stop shop” for all things take out/delivery. Our sincere hope is that our community will support each and every one so that we may soon visit your establishments and again enjoy what makes the Ohio Valley so great, our people.</p>

          <p>This little site is as basic as it gets (plain old' HTML and CSS). We were tempted to throw all the latest tech at this site, but realized that may interfere with our goal of building a resource that any community could quickly use.</p>
