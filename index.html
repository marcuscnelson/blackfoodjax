          <p>Our communities grow stronger together.</p>
          <p>This list is a result of a collaborative effort of groups, non-profits and individuals working to revitalize and economically stimulate NW Jacksonville.</p>
          <p>This webpage highlights all the places we can support by ordering meals and helping them stay in business until these troubling times pass.</p>
          <p>Over 40% of Black owned restaurants in the county are located in NW Jacksonville, and another 25% are in the Westside.</p>		
          <p>Want to help us? Fill out our form & submit any restaurants that we've missed. Our hope is to make this a “one stop shop” for all things black food. Our sincere hope is that our community will support each and every one so that we may grow closer together and continue as a key part of what makes Jacksonville a beautiful place.</p>
