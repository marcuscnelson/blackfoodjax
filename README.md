# Takeout

We saw a lot of questions on social media asking what restaurants were open and accepting to-go orders or deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic, so we started this simple project to display them all in one place.

We love fancy tech as much as the next developer, but we wanted to keep this as simple as possible so anyone with basic development knowledge could quickly spin up their own community site.

Built by the folks at [Omni Strategic Technologies](https://omniperforms.com).

## Websites Using Takeout

| State | Region | Website |
|-------|--------|---------|
| West Virginia | Kanawha Valley | [kvtakeout.com](kvtakeout.com)
| Ohio | Ohio Valley | [ovtakeout.com](ovtakeout.com)

## How to Use this Project

This project consists of a static index.html containing an <a href="http://airtable.com">Airtable</a> embed for displaying restaurant data.

Essentially, you just need to clone this repo and swap out the static content, which is commented in the source code.

### Airtable Embed

To make things even easier, you can view and copy the Airtable base for kvtakeout.com here; <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invWanNWCAZC5w1Md&inviteToken=375e7d1dde5a4a35064ad6225b4eee04056bd09beabb757ec484a7c510a8417e">KV Takeout Base</a>

### Logo

You'll also want to modify the logo slightly. The logo is presented as an SVG, and the letters within the takeout box icon are set within a `<text>` tag. Just type in your new initials!
